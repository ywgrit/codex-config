# PostToolUse Bash Hook for RLCR loop
#
# Records the Claude Code session_id into state.md immediately after setup.
# This hook fires right after the setup script's Bash command completes.
#
# Mechanism:
# 1. Setup script creates .humanize/.pending-session-id with:
#    Line 1: path to state.md
#    Line 2: full resolved path of setup script (command signature)
# 2. This hook checks for the signal file on every Bash PostToolUse event
# 3. Boundary-aware match: verifies the Bash command is a valid invocation
#    of the setup script path (path followed by end-of-string or whitespace),
#    preventing false positives from substrings and concatenated forms
# 4. Extracts session_id from hook JSON input
# 5. Patches state.md with the session_id value using safe awk replacement
# 6. Removes the signal file (one-shot mechanism)
#
# This ensures session_id is recorded BEFORE any team members can be created,
# so only the team leader (main session) is affected by RLCR loop hooks.
